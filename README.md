### PYTHON 3.X IS REQUIRED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM ###
### .db FILE CAN BE OPENED EXTERNALLY USING SQLITE3 DATABASE SOFTWARE ###

A Python GUI project using tkinter module.
Its my first project so not very thorough with the finer details.
Working on linking this with SQLite3 Databse for Python
All data will be stored to log.txt
Open.txt was just a file created for testing

UPDATE: 
SQLite3 has been configured for this application. 
Text files no longer required.
